[DISCOVERIES]
- 2026-02-09T09:33:21Z [TOOL] Header height varies enough by breakpoint/font rendering that a measured CSS variable is more reliable than clamp-based estimates for full-bleed hero overlap.
- 2026-02-09T09:23:06Z [TOOL] With an opaque sticky header in normal flow, extending hero background to viewport top requires visual overlap (`margin-top` offset) rather than only height calculations.
- 2026-02-09T09:19:49Z [TOOL] With a sticky header in normal document flow, pure `100dvh` hero height can make content feel low; subtracting a responsive header offset restores optical centering in the first viewport.
- 2026-02-09T09:14:55Z [TOOL] To make one section span the whole screen inside a constrained layout, width: 100vw with margin-left/right calc(50% - 50vw) is the lowest-risk full-bleed pattern in this codebase.
- 2026-02-09T09:09:40Z [TOOL] Once spotlight is removed, using featuredItems.slice(1) silently drops one featured card; mapping Featured Work directly from all featured items preserves expected content density.
- 2026-02-09T09:03:10Z [TOOL] Pairing meta color-scheme with runtime documentElement colorScheme and aligned root colors gives a cleaner dark-mode first paint than relying on media-query fallback alone.
- 2026-02-09T09:03:10Z [TOOL] A single-column hero plus split spotlight card can emulate the reference editorial flow without adding or removing homepage sections.
- 2026-02-09T08:33:41Z [TOOL] Excess top whitespace was driven by stacked vertical spacing (`Page` top padding + Hero bottom margin + HeroText inner padding); reducing all three produced better rhythm with the updated separator spacing.
- 2026-02-09T08:22:46Z [TOOL] Uneven separator spacing was caused by compounded spacing (`SectionSeparator` margins plus `Section` top margin); flattening section top margin makes separator rhythm consistent.
- 2026-02-09T08:13:34Z [TOOL] After card removal, a plain gradient divider line reads cleaner than a line-plus-dot treatment and keeps section rhythm without drawing excess focus.
- 2026-02-09T08:08:52Z [TOOL] A thin gradient line with a small center dot preserves the clean no-card layout while still giving clear section delineation.
- 2026-02-09T08:03:19Z [TOOL] Removing wrapper-card chrome from sections improves continuity with the global gradient while leaving item-level cards available for project scannability.
- 2026-02-09T07:39:53Z [TOOL] The previous 3-stop gradient could read center-weighted in dark mode because first and final stops converged; a 2-stop horizontal gradient removes that effect.
- 2026-02-09T07:35:20Z [TOOL] Splitting the heading into plain text plus styled span gives fine-grained gradient emphasis without reintroducing full-heading readability issues from earlier iterations.
- 2026-02-09T07:27:54Z [TOOL] Theme default behavior is controlled entirely by ThemeContext fallback branch; changing it does not affect saved user preference restore logic.
- 2026-02-09T07:19:08Z [TOOL] Footer panels were initially brighter than cards even after first chrome-token pass; lowering dark chromeStrong to #0A1932 established the intended depth ordering.
- 2026-02-09T07:08:51Z [TOOL] Dark-mode perceived brightness is driven by both base color and radial-glow tokens; reducing `backgroundAccentA/B` materially darkens the scene without sacrificing hue identity.
- 2026-02-09T07:04:35Z [TOOL] In this app, checking CSS variables (--bg-base, --text-primary) via Playwright is the most reliable way to verify theme-token swaps across persisted toggle states.
- 2026-02-09T06:58:22Z [TOOL] Global link-name selectors can hit header links first; validating hero CTAs should be scoped under `main` to avoid false negatives.
- 2026-02-09T06:51:56Z [TOOL] Theme toggle persisted prior mode in localStorage; validation must inspect `aria-label` and capture both states explicitly.
- 2026-02-09T06:41:50Z [TOOL] Solid CTA color (`#B39CD0`) surfaces as `background-color` (not `background-image`), so verification for button role should inspect color property.
- 2026-02-09T06:37:25Z [TOOL] LocalStorage kept dark mode active on first load; explicit theme-toggle verification was required to confirm both palette variants.
- 2026-02-09T03:28:23Z [TOOL] The cutesy feel came from inherited Fraunces serif on `h1`; a local hero override to `Red Hat Display` changes tone without affecting other headings.
- 2026-02-09T03:25:52Z [TOOL] Converting the kicker to `h1` preserves semantic primary heading while simplifying layout by removing the extra hero title block.
- 2026-02-09T03:10:46Z [TOOL] Playwright bounding boxes confirm the tagline aligns on the same row as the logo pill, eliminating the prior 閳ユ笩ubtitle sticking out below閳?effect.
- 2026-02-09T03:02:16Z [TOOL] Live runtime at `http://localhost:5173/` matches source-level typography adjustments for the brand name in both header and footer.
- 2026-02-09T03:01:33Z [TOOL] Additional uppercase text remains intentional on non-name elements (e.g., taglines); brand name itself is already lowercase by string and CSS transform rules.
- 2026-02-09T03:00:48Z [TOOL] Header and footer previously appeared all-caps due to CSS text-transform, not string casing; changing style preserved existing brand text content.
- 2026-02-09T02:43:58Z [TOOL] Count summary removal is isolated to Home section heading and does not affect project filter behavior.
- 2026-02-09T02:41:14Z [TOOL] Vertical text alignment issue was caused by inherited body line-height; explicit inline-flex centering + line-height on chips/button fixes it without affecting overall footer layout.
- 2026-02-09T02:38:45Z [TOOL] Centering the footer layout required only local BrandPanel/MetaRow alignment changes; no grid column changes were needed.
- 2026-02-09T02:36:38Z [TOOL] The requested result is achieved by deleting only Hero::before; no additional spacing or layout adjustments were required.
- 2026-02-09T02:34:00Z [TOOL] Repositioning only the pseudo-element inset achieved the requested visual move without needing layout or spacing changes.
- 2026-02-09T02:32:47Z [TOOL] Hero remains visually balanced after removing metrics because availability pill and CTA row preserve spacing hierarchy.
- 2026-02-09T02:10:04Z [TOOL] Initial homepage and R&D snapshots showed loading placeholders before content arrived, indicating delayed/intermittent content availability.
- 2026-02-09T02:15:10Z [TOOL] PowerShell Set-Content defaults can introduce UTF-16; UTF-8 encoding must be enforced for patch compatibility.
- 2026-02-09T02:29:14Z [TOOL] styled-components warns against @import in createGlobalStyle; moving font loading to index.html removes the warning source.
- 2026-02-09T02:29:14Z [TOOL] A transient HMR runtime error appeared after mid-edit refresh; full browser restart/reload cleared stale module state.
